##  What I learned?
* I learned to generate an image using PHP and I learned how to pass a query parameter in the  url so the other files can access the variables I set globally. In this case I used `$ticketName = isset($_GET['name']) ? $_GET['name'] : '';` to retrieve the variable i set in the URL query parameter.
